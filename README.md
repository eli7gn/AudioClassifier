# Audio Classifier with XGBoost and CNN

This repository contains code to train three possible audio classification models:
* XGBoost is a decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework.
* CNN network 
* Ensemble model using Logistic regression and the two previous models  

The input is a flat spectogram 
The model can be applied to a wide range of audio files outside the domain of music/speech.
